# Binary Tree:

### if a   node in a Tree can have at most two children is called a Binary tree

## Types of Binary Trees:

### Full Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if every node has 0 or 2 children , then that binary tree is called full binary tree

### Complete Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if every node has 2 children except for th last level, which has all nodes as left as possible

### Perfect Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if every node has exactly 2 children except for the last level, which has 0 children(leaves)

### Balanced Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the height of left subtree and right subtree differ by a factor of not more than 1<br>
eg: AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees
